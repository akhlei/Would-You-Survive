Will You Survive was suggested as web game, where the user supplies some basic physical and psychological information, picks a historical era, and is informed how long they'll survive. 
Users authenticate through a Facebook login (currently in a developer mode, application would require review by Facebook for public users). Once authenticated, they navigate through our Sinatra frameworked based site. Height and weight is entered as well as a variety of character traits. The user picks one of five eras, and an result is generated from our SQL database. They can then post a comment about their result, which is stored in our database, and can be shared on Facebook as a comment. The share link is a placeholder since the website is not live.
